# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

Design a reponsive "About Me" web site that will render well on different devices of different sizes and windows. Three HTML files were used to display the different screens when the links were pushed on the navigation bar. Bootstrap was used in almost all of the components for the building of the website. Screenshots are in the Assets/Images folder of this repository.
